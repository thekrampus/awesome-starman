## what

[awesome][awesome] is pretty neat. I use it for my window manager basically whenever I get the chance. This repo is my own personal configuration and also my personal theme, which I call **starman**. It's here half because I can just clone this repo to set up new devices, and half because I know all y'all cool cats want to check a look at it.

A word of warning: this uses some way weird keybindings and personalizations and I have made virtually no attempt to document them, nor do I totally intend to. If you want to use this then like go for it dude, at your own peril.

some highlights:
* home-grown icon set for everything
* chill colors n wallpaper
* it's [𝓙𝓪𝓶𝓶𝓲𝓷'!](/../../../awesome-jammin)
* shoutouts to my Earthbound crew
* :fire: HOT like FIRE :fire:
